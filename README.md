This repository consists of two notebooks for Kaggle's [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
competition. In the first notebook I present a relatively detailed EDA I conducted to gain a better understanding of the problem and in the second notebook i present 
the full pipeline from feature engineering to final predictions, icluding the implementation of various models combined into an ensemble and stacked model,
resulting into an RMSE = 0.14179.
